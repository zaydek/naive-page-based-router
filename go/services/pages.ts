// TODO: Need to write a service that given a payload of files (the router?),
// React renders `<Head>` and `<Root>` to string, including support for
// `pageProps`. `pageProps` should probably be passed as a field in the JSON
// payload so that we donâ€™t have to worry about requiring more than the minimum
// number of files, which helps with error-handling.
