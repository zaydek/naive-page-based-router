server framework for server-generating and rendering react

desired flags would be

reactstrictmode
experimentalreactsuspense
noscript (do not emit any javascript whatsoever, assets are fine)
ssg (server generation; statically generate all pages with a shared bundle file)
ssr (server rendering; generate source or a program that can be used to ssr)
- ssr requirements are different; has to do with caching page rebuilds, caching header responses
disablerouter (disable the top-level router; pages are loosely linked; navigation clicks require hard page reloads)
disablelivereload (disable live reload)

we might even want a spa-option where we intentionally don't build pages and instead build the
whole thing as a one-off app. this would mean pages are always rendered as opposed to hydrated.
why do this? then we can have client-side rendering too. this makes it easier / possibly to
experiment with browser-only apis like suspense

maybe we do like `export RENDERING = "CSR" | "SSR" | "SSG"`
this might be a bad idea because for example suspense is meant to wrap the whole app

want a way to be able to say per route whether it should be generated or rendered
