ssg-rendered pages
page.csr.js
	- ~~the only way this works if we don't emit a corresponding html file and our
		hosting provided understands that we want to route to index.html always~~
	- ~~then we may have a problem where our index.html is already generated and
		therefore we have an unexpected page flash. so we can either us a fully
		dynamic 404 or maybe we just don't support this use-case and we make it
		possible to create retro apps that use the same cli but are fully dynamic
		(maybe we should have done this from the beginning)~~
	- no -- we are over-engineering. we basically need to change the equation so
		that for these pages **we do** emit an html file but we use render not
		hydrate. so maybe this becomes a parameter attached to every page-based
		route; whether it's client-side rendered or server-side generated
