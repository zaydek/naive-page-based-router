unsolved problems:

automatic document title and css linking
router store (extracts params)

what problems does retro not solve?

the way to think about retro is that it aims to be the slimmest implementation possible to:

descriptive cli experience
provide an integrated store
provide an integrated router
watch, build, and serve your projects
ssg support

ssr support is

provide a clear cli experience
provide a store and router
watch, build, and serve react projects

retro does not attempt to solve the following problems:

1:1 feature parity with create-react-app
integrate babel support
print eslint warnings in the console (you should use this vscode extension for eslint support)
